- Hello everyone, my name is Art and I am starting my journey to become a web developer


Some one 

```
Hi everyone! I am just starting this course and I am really excited about it. I have done my bachelors in Software Engineering and have two years industrial experience. I started out as a back end developer, but somehow ended up as a full stack developer. I feel like I know things but at a very basic level because i have never been given enough time to dive into something in depth. This is something that has urged me to take up this course to get proper guidance and be better at what I do. Here's to hoping that we enjoy a lot during this time
